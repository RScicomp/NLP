    "Pat Garrett and Brian Watson founded Six Park in 2014 while working together at their investment management firm in Melbourne, Australia. Pat and Brian met in the mid-1990s while Brian was managing the global private equity and venture capital investment unit of JP Morgan (New York), and have been working together in Melbourne since 2001. They decided they could no longer ignore a major problem in Australia's investment management industry ‚Äì namely, that it was difficult, confusing, expensive and frustrating for most Australian investors to get professional, low-cost investment advice. Worse, there was ample evidence that investors' best interests had taken a back seat to the interests of larger financial institutions. Pat and Brian met in the mid 1990's while Brian was managing the global private equity and venture capital investment unit of JP Morgan (New York), and have been working together in Melbourne, Australia since 2001. In June 2014, Pat and Brian started building a better solution for Australian investors ‚Äì a trustworthy, professionally managed, low-cost, and highly accessible investment guidance service that is not aligned with a financial institution.

    "MarketRiders, Inc. is an easy-to use online service that allows anyone to join the Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) revolution using strategies previously only available to elite investors and large endowments like Yale and Harvard.  For $14.95 per month and 30 minutes each quarter, anyone can build and manage their own ETF portfolio and grow their money like the world's smartest investors. Traditional wisdom suggests that being successful in the stock market is about picking the right stocks or hiring the right financial advisor to manage one's money.  Study after study proves, though, that it's not possible to \"beat the market\" with any consistency, and that the most successful investors ride the market by allocating their assets across broad sections of the market and re-balancing when their asset allocations get out of whack.  While mutual funds purport to do this sort of thing, they typically charge investors 2% or more off the top, whether they're making money or not, and have tax implications that are often unfriendly to investors.  Over time, these taxes and fees can erode 30-50% of an average portfolio! MarketRiders allows investors to take control of their own money in a three step process as follows:  1. User inputs data points such as age and risk tolerance, and based on those factors, MarketRiders suggests a portfolio based on ETFs (low-fee index funds typically associated with buckets of stocks or commodities).  User can customize the portfolio or copy a successful portfolio from another MarketRiders user. 2. MarketRiders sends user a lists of trades to make at his or her online broker. Once user confirms purchases and prices, MarketRiders begins monitoring user's account for necessary changes based on rules and alerts that user can configure.  3. MarketRiders watches each user portfolio and alerts user when he or she needs to make changes.  If for example, a user wants to maintain 10% in coal, and coal makes a run such that 15% of the user's portfolio is now in coal, MarketRiders suggests the necessary trades to bring the portfolio back to the desired asset allocation.\n",

    "sample_3 = \"\"\"WASHINGTON, April 19, 2018—Financial inclusion is on the rise globally, accelerated by mobile phones and the internet, but gains have been uneven across countries. A new World Bank report on the use of financial services also finds that men remain more likely than women to have an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Globally, 69 percent of adults – 3.8 billion people – now have an account at a bank or mobile money provider, a crucial step in escaping poverty.  This is up from 62 percent in 2014 and just 51 percent in 2011. From 2014 to 2017, 515 million adults obtained an account, and 1.2 billion have done so since 2011, according to the Global Findex database. While in some economies account ownership has surged, progress has been slower elsewhere, often held back by large disparities between men and women and between the rich and poor. The gap between men and women in developing economies remains unchanged since 2011, at 9 percentage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Global Findex, a wide-ranging data set on how people in 144 economies use financial services, was produced by the World Bank with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and in collaboration with Gallup, Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "“In the past few years, we have seen great strides around the world in connecting people to formal financial services,” World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. “Financial inclusion allows people to save for family needs, borrow to support a business, or build a cushion against an emergency. Having access to financial services is a critical step towards reducing both poverty and inequality, and new data on mobile phone ownership and internet access show unprecedented opportunities to use technology to achieve universal financial inclusion.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Download The Global Findex Database 2017: Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a significant increase in the use of mobile phones and the internet to conduct financial transactions. Between 2014 and 2017, this has contributed to a rise in the share of account owners sending or receiving payments digitally from 67 percent to 76 percent globally, and in the developing world from 57 percent to 70 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    " “The Global Findex shows great progress for financial access--and also great opportunities for policymakers and the private sector to increase usage and to expand inclusion among women, farmers and the poor,” H.M. Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development, said. “Digital financial services were the key to our recent progress and will continue to be essential as we seek to achieve universal financial inclusion.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Globally, 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked, yet two-thirds of them own a mobile phone that could help them access financial services. Digital technology could take advantage of existing cash transactions to bring people into the financial system, the report finds. For example, paying government wages, pensions, and social benefits directly into accounts could bring formal financial services to up to 100 million more adults globally, including 95 million in developing economies. There are other opportunities to increase account ownership and use through digital payments: more than 200 million unbanked adults who work in the private sector are paid in cash only, as are more than 200 million who receive agricultural payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We already know a lot about how to make sure women have equal access to financial services that can change their lives,” Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said. “When the government deposits social welfare payments or other subsidies directly into women’s digital bank accounts, the impact is amazing. Women gain decision-making power in their homes, and with more financial tools at their disposal they invest in their families’ prosperity and help drive broad economic growth.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This edition of the Global Findex database includes updated indicators on access to and use of formal and informal financial services.  It adds data on the use of financial technology, including mobile phones and the internet to conduct financial transactions, and is based on over 150,000 interviews around the world. The database has been published every three years since 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The Global Findex database has become a mainstay of global efforts to promote financial inclusion,” World Bank Development Research Group Director Asli Demirgüç-Kunt said. “The data offer a wealth of information for development practitioners, policymakers and scholars, and are helping track progress toward the World Bank Group goal of Universal Financial Access by 2020 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Regional Overviews\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile money drove financial inclusion. While the share of adults with a financial institution account remained flat, the share with a mobile money account almost doubled, to 21 percent. Since 2014, mobile money accounts have spread from East Africa to West Africa and beyond. The region is home to all eight economies where 20 percent or more of adults use only a mobile money account: Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Opportunities abound to increase account ownership: up to 95 million unbanked adults in the region receive cash payments for agricultural products, and roughly 65 million save using semiformal methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In East Asia and the Pacific, the use of digital financial transactions grew even as account ownership stagnated. Today, 71 percent of adults have an account, little changed from 2014. An exception is Indonesia, where the share with an account rose by 13 percentage points to 49 percent. Gender inequality is low: men and women are equally likely to have an account in Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Digital financial transactions have accelerated especially in China, where the share of account owners using the internet to pay bills or buy things more than doubled—to 57 percent. Digital technology could be leveraged to further increase account use: 405 million account owners in the region pay utility bills in cash, though 95 percent of them have a mobile phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Europe and Central Asia, account ownership rose from 58 percent of adults in 2014 to 65 percent in 2017. Digital government payments of wages, pensions, and social benefits helped drive that increase. Among those with an account, 17 percent opened their first one to receive government payments. The share of adults making or receiving digital payments jumped by 14 percentage points to 60 percent. Digitizing all public pension payments could reduce the number of unbanked adults by up to 20 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Latin America and the Caribbean, wide access to digital technology could enable rapid growth in financial technology use: 55 percent of adults own a mobile phone and have access to the internet, 15 percentage points more than the developing world average. Since 2014, the share of adults making or receiving digital payments has risen by about 8 percentage points or more in such economies as Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Haiti, and Peru. About 20 percent adults with an account use mobile or the internet to make a transaction through an account in Argentina, Brazil, and Costa Rica. By digitizing cash wage payments, businesses could expand account ownership to up to 30 million unbanked adults—almost 90 percent of whom have a mobile phone. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Middle East and North Africa, opportunities to increase financial inclusion are particularly strong among women. Today 52 percent of men but only 35 percent of women have an account, the largest gender gap of any region. Relatively high mobile phone ownership offers an avenue for expanding financial inclusion: among the unbanked, 86 percent of men and 75 percent of women have a mobile phone. Up to 20 million unbanked adults in the region send or receive domestic remittances using cash or an over-the-counter service, including 7 million in the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In South Asia, the share of adults with an account rose by 23 percentage points, to 70 percent. Progress was driven by India, where a government policy to increase financial inclusion through biometric identification pushed the share with an account up to 80 percent, with big gains among women and poorer adults. Excluding India, regional account ownership still rose by 12 percentage points—but men often benefited more than women. In Bangladesh, the share with an account rose by 10 percentage points among women while nearly doubling among men. Regionwide, digitizing payments for agricultural products could reduce the number of unbanked adults by roughly 40 million.\n",

       "'Current systems at land borders in Hong Kong perform facial recognition through rolled-down windows, simply to avoid the confounding effect of the glass.But over the past few months, a new system has emerged to solve that problem, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory at the request of US Customs and Border Patrol. If effective, it could pave the way for far more aggressive deployment of facial recognition at automotive crossings.“The camera they have developed can go into a vehicle through tint and glare.”The system arose out of an initiative called biometric exit, which mandates a face or fingerprint verification of every US visitor as they exit the country. Colvin Pitts, a senior architect at Lytro, says the camera’s depth-sensing capability could be particularly useful when cleaning up an image for facial recognition. That’s consistent with Manaher’s early assessment, which described the system as “very prototypey.” “There is very little practical way to opt out of this system.”As the technology develops, it could enable ambitious new facial recognition projects, particularly when combined with automatic license plate recognition or ALPR technology. Last Year, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced a plan called New York Crossings that would install facial recognition cameras alongside ALPR systems at every bridge and tunnel leading into Manhattan, although experts say there are still significant logistical challenges to such a system.'"
